Use ACTiVATED crack on Steam game

This script should be used only for fair purposes like making your own backup
copies of games you own on your account. It not supposed to be used for piracy.

## Install

Copy latest ACTiVATED crack `.so`-files to
`$HOME/.local/share/activate/x86/libsteam_api.so` and
`$HOME/.local/share/activate/x86_64/libsteam_api.so`. Copy script file (`activate`)
anywhere in your `$PATH`, e.g. `/usr/local/bin`.

## Use

Go to game directory and enter `activate`. The script may ask for AppID if it
can't find it. That's it.

````
cd ~/Games/SuperSteamGame
activate
````

It will replace libsteam_api.so files with ACTiVATED crack
(of right architecture), detect a version of Steam interfaces and fill
activated.ini files with right interfaces section.
